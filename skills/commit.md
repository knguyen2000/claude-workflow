# /commit

Stage local changes, generate a commit message from the diff, commit, push. Use when you made the changes yourself and want to ship without writing the message by hand.

## Step 1: Safety checks

`git status` + `git branch --show-current`.

**On `main`/`master`:** don't stop — run Steps 2-3 first (understand changes, detect conventions), then suggest a branch name:

```
You are on main. It is not safe to commit directly here.
Suggested branch: feat/short-description-of-change
Create this branch and continue? [yes / use a different name / cancel]
```

If approved, check whether local main is behind remote first (don't `git pull` directly — uncommitted changes are already on main and a pull could conflict):

```
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
```

Commits shown? Warn: `Local main is N commits behind origin/main. Continue anyway, or stash changes, pull, then reapply? [continue / stash-and-pull]`. Stash-and-pull → `git stash && git pull && git stash pop`, then proceed.

`git checkout -b <branch-name>` (or the dev's name). Cancelled → stop.

**Clean tree:** stop, tell the dev there's nothing to commit.

## Step 2: Detect conventions

`git log --oneline -20` + `git branch -a`.

**Branch naming:** `feat/`/`fix/`/`chore/` → type/slug; `feature/`/`bugfix/`/`hotfix/` → longer type/slug; `username/description` → owner/slug; no pattern → default `type/short-slug`. Use this for Step 1's suggestion — slug reflects the actual change, short/lowercase/hyphenated.

**Commit format:** `type(scope): description` or `type: description` → Conventional Commits; `[TAG] description` → bracket tags; none → default Conventional Commits. Apply in Step 4.

**Types:** `feat` new feature · `fix` bug fix · `docs` docs only · `refactor` no behavior change · `test` test-only · `chore` config/build/tooling · `style` formatting only · `perf` performance.

## Step 3: Read the changes

`git diff HEAD` + `git diff --staged`. Check `git status` for untracked files related to the change (same dir/feature name) — ask if they should be included.

Scan the diff for secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys) — found any → list file:line and stop, don't commit.

Understand all changed files before writing anything.

## Step 4: Write the commit message

One message covering all changes:
- **Subject:** <72 chars, imperative mood (`add`/`fix`/`update`, not `added`/`adds`)
- **Language:** simple, direct, no idioms — technical terms fine
- **Scope:** most specific codebase area changed
- **Body:** only if the subject can't capture full intent; 2-3 lines max, explains *why*
- **Unrelated changes:** split into separate commits (ask first)

## Step 5: Confirm with the dev

```
## Files to stage
- modified: path/to/file.py

## Commit message
type(scope): short description

Optional body line explaining why.

Proceed? [yes / edit / cancel]
```

Wait for confirmation, an edited message, or cancel.

## Step 6: Stage, commit, push

Stage each file explicitly by name — never `git add .` or `git add -A`. Commit. Push to upstream (`git push -u origin <branch-name>` if none set). Report the commit hash and confirm the push.

## Step 7: Create PR

`gh pr create` with title = commit subject and body:

```
## Summary
- [1-3 bullets: what changed and why]

## Changes
- [files/areas changed, one line each]

## Test Plan
- [ ] [thing to verify manually]
```

Keep sections short, same plain language as the commit message. Target `main`/`master`. Report the PR URL — don't merge.

No `gh` or not authenticated → print title+body as text for the dev to create manually.
